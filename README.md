Guitars. Decentralized.
6 Strings Project (6S) is an asset tracking system. In this case the assets are guitars. 
The values of guitars vary around the world. There have been guitars sold for hundreds of thousands, even millions of dollars in some cases. There worth also goes beyond just money. 
6S wants to make it safer from bad things happening to great instruments, and their owners whether it’s a retail store, a rock star, a wall street trader, or an electrician, guitars are worth something tangible.  

We’re building a global digital ledger that tracks and protects valuable assets throughout their lifetime journey. We collect an asset’s defining characteristics, history, and ownership to create a permanent record on the blockchain with smart contracts. This digital thumbprint, is used by various stakeholders across a supply chain pipeline to form authenticity.

We also believe that this project can open many doors in the “Blockchain For Small Business” areas of this fantastic way of trade.
We are in the infancy stage of coding, but with additional help we can be testing by the 4th quarter of 2018 and fully functional with a release date of 1/1/2019.

We're using the business network definition model. The files are started so please refer to the rest of this repo. Let's make this happen.
